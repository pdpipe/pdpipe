# More about pdpipe

## Features

!!! python "Compatible with Python 3+"

```
Python 3.7 and up. Crucial for new or forward-looking projects.
```

!!! docs "Fully documented"

```
Every pipeline stage and parameter are meticulously documented and accompanied by working code examples.
```

!!! magic "Zero configuration"

```
Pdpipe stages use sensible defaults for everything. Get things going immediately, tune only what you need.
```

!!! hierarchy "Handle mixed-type data"

```
Easily create pipelines that process different types of data separately without breaking, enabling easier use of stacking-based ensemble models down the pipeline.
```

!!! config "Customizable stages"

```
Pipeline stages are highly configurable, and creating new custom stages is easy.
```

!!! link "Chainable constructors & pipeline arithmetics"

```
Chaining pipeline stages constructor calls for easy, one-liners creating complex pipelines. Supports pipeline arithmetics.
```

!!! server "Built for productization"

```
Pipelines and stages are written with productization in mind; fit on training data, serialize, deserialize and transform in production.
```

!!! clipboard-check "Fully tested"

```
Pdpipe is thoroughly tested on Linux, macOS and Windows systems, as well as all Python development branches, and boasts full test coverage.
```

!!! eye "Verbose"

```
Informative prints and errors on pipeline application, including smart pre-conditions before application and post-conditions to validate successful application.
```

## Design Decisions

!!! info "Extra informative naming"

```
Meant to make pipelines very readable, understanding their entire flow by pipeline stages names; e.g. ColDrop vs. ValDrop instead of an all-encompassing Drop stage emulating the `pandas.DataFrame.drop` method.
```

!!! scatter-plot "Data science & ML oriented"

```
The target use case is transforming tabular data into a vectorized dataset on which a machine learning model will be trained; e.g., column transformations will drop the source columns to avoid strong linear dependence.
```

!!! function "A functional approach"

```
Pipelines never change input DataFrames. Nothing is done "in place".
```

!!! opinion "Opinionated operations"

```
Help novices avoid mistake by default appliance of good practices; e.g., one-hot-encoding (creating dummy variables) a column will drop one of the resulting columns by default, to avoid [the dummy variable trap](http://www.algosome.com/articles/dummy-variable-trap-regression.html) (perfect [multicollinearity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicollinearity)).
